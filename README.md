# Assessment

The goal of this project is to use ReactJS capabilities and its paradigms by creating a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

This exercise must be completed within a week. The fully functional code must be uploaded to github. The work must be yours, no other person should be directly or indirectly involved. After you complete the work please provide us the git hub link where we can download and assess the work.

## Instructions

Inside of [index.html](/index.html), you'll find some starter HTML. You shouldn't need to edit this file at all. Open this file on your computer into any browser to run the project. Make sure that [script.js](/script.js) and [styles.css](/styles.css)
are in the same local directory. With the file open in your browser, you should see a `New TODO` button, which `alert`s when clicked. Your goal will be to get this button to create new TODOs.

Inside [styles.css](/styles.css), you'll find some pre-written CSS for your convenience. You shouldn't need to edit this file at all, but feel free to if desired.

[script.js](/script.js) is where most of your work will be done. There is some starter code for you in the file. The `classNames` variable can be used to link any elements you create in js with the associated CSS class names. The next 3 lines of code are the HTML elements that you'll need to update when creating new
TODOs. Lastly, you'll see the `addTodo()` function. This gets executed when creating a new TODO. You should replace the `alert()` call with logic to create new TODOs.
Reminder: The above work needs to be done using ReactJS

Good luck!

## Challenge! (Not Required)

If you finish early and are up for a challenge, try adding delete functionality. This should be in the form of a button within each TODO that removes that TODO when clicked.

I have provided three answers for this particular task.

1.  Trying to stick to This multiple root element structure.
2.  Using SPA strucuture with including scripts in browser
3.  Using SPA structure with webpack 4

I would personally prefer wtiting React app using structure "3" above. which is the standard structure that "create-react-app" CLI
uses. You can notice that the work was more seemless with this structure because I am more well versed with it

This is a Todo App created with React.It is a Single Page Application with including scripts in browser.

Features:

1. counting current todos
2. count on unchecked Todos
3. Checking and unchecking todos
4. deleting to do from todolist

# running app

open in visual Studio code
open index.html
right click and select "open in live server"
